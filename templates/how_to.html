<h5>Game Setup</h5>
<p>When creating the game there a couple choices to make. The first being the game name. This is where you get creative and choose a name that works best for your friends that you'll be playing with. Next you have the choice of the number of sentences that this game will contain. This dictates how long the game will go and when all sentences are complete, the game ends. Finally you have the number of words to be shown. As the game progresses, each player will be adding words to the sentences. The number of words shown controls how many previous words each player can see when it's their turn to add the next word. Once the game has been created, the creator can then shared the game code with their friends so they can join the game and play along. </p>
<h5>Game Play</h5>
<p>A game is started when all the players have joined and the creator selects to start the game. Each player will take a turn to add the next word to the sentence. You will only have <b>30 seconds</b> to pick a word or you'll be skipped, so be quick! This time limit keeps the game moving so the rest of your friends aren't waiting for ever. You will only be able to see the previous <i>X</i> words in the sentence, where <i>X</i> is set by the creator upon creating the game. If you add a word that ends with a period, it will end that current sentence.</p>
<h5>Game End</h5>
<p>The game ends when all sentences have been completed. After the game ends you'll be able to view all the sentences that you and your friends created and also you'll be able to see the breakdown of each word and who added it.</p>
<p>Don't forget to share with your friends! And most importantly, have lots of fun creating some amazing sentences with your friends!</p>
